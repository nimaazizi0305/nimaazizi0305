# 💫 About Me:
<h2 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Nima Azizi</h2>
<h4 align="center">a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tabriz, specializing in developing solutions based on machine learning and deep learning. I am skilled in implementing neural network models such as MLP, CNN, and LSTM using TensorFlow and Keras, and I have successful experience in designing intelligent systems to diagnose diseases such as thyroid and breast cancer with an accuracy of over 89%. In addition to my university education, I have completed prestigious courses in machine learning and web development from Stanford University and the University of Michigan, and I have always strived to combine theoretical knowledge with practical skills. I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects that leverage advanced technologies to create positive change.</h4>
